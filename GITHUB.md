### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account

---

### Cloning the Repository

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**:
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use the `git clone` command to clone the repository. 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BabaScience/mern-boilerplate
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - After cloning, navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd mern-boilerplate
   ```

### Creating a New GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**:
   - Log in to your GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click the **New** button on your GitHub dashboard or navigate to `https://github.com/new`.
   - Name your repository (e.g., `my-frontend-app`).
   - You can choose to initialize with a README (not necessary since you already have content).

3. **Do Not Initialize with a README, .gitignore, or License**:
   - Ensure these options are unchecked if GitHub prompts you during creation.

4. **Copy the Repository URL**:
   - After creation, GitHub will redirect you to the repository page. Copy the URL provided (it should look like `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`).

### Setting Up the New Remote

1. **Remove the Old Remote**:
   - If the project was cloned from a different repository, remove the existing remote:
   ```bash
   git remote remove origin
   ```

2. **Add Your New GitHub Repository as a Remote**:
   - Add your newly created GitHub repository as the new `origin` remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

3. **Verify the New Remote**:
   - Check that the remote URL is correct:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```
   - You should see output like:
   ```
   origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git (push)
   ```

---

### Pushing to Your GitHub Repository

1. **Push the Code to Your Repository**:
   - Push the cloned code to your new GitHub repository. The `-u` flag sets the `origin` remote as the default remote for future pushes.
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   If your local branch is named `master`, use `master` instead of `main`.

2. **Handle Large Pushes**:
   - If you have large files or many files, Git may take a moment to process the push.

---

### Verifying the Push

1. **Go to Your GitHub Repository**:
   - Visit your GitHub repository in your browser (`https://github.com/your-username/your-repo`).

2. **Check the Files**:
   - Ensure all your project files have been uploaded correctly.

3. **Future Changes**:
   - For future changes, you can commit your changes locally and push them using:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push
   ```
